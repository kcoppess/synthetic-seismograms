This repository contains the Python-based code to calculate synthetic seismograms for simulated volcanic 
eruptions. The code carries out steps 2 and 3 in the workflow presented in Coppess et al (2022). 
Pressure and wall shear traction changes for a conduit-chamber system are converted to moment tensor and 
vertical force histories, using the representation theorem developed in Coppess et al (2022). The source
histories are then convolved with numerical elastic Green's functions to calculate seismograms for 
specified receiver positions.
